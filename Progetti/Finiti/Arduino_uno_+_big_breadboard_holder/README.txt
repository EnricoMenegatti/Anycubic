# Summary

UPDATE: I uploaded a new STL.

There are plenty of arduino holders on thingiverse but not a lot that combine the power of the arduino uno and the mighty breadboard. A friend of mine requested to make a holder that can hold them both and have a visual pleasing but functional design. This is what I came up with.  

This is a slight modification to my previous design so it holds large breadboards instead of the half-size breadboards.  

It will fit arduino UNO's only as far as I now (they have rounded corners) together with a half-sized breadboard. Don't worry about the double-sided tape that's normally on the bottom breadboard. It has been designed to have enough room for it.  

Design was created in Sketchup.
