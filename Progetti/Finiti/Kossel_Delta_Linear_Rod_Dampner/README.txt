# Summary

I designed some dampeners to span my linear rods on my Anycubic Kossel plus to dampen the vibrations. The rods were "clicking" during fast movements. The dampeners clip onto the parallel rods to put a slight amount of tension between them and eliminate the clicking pretty much altogether. 

The stl file is made so that the distance on the outside of the bars of the printer is 60.5 mm (0.5 mm tolerance for actual 60 mm outer distance) and the bar diameter is 5 mm (.25 mm tolerance built in). The height and thickness of the clip is 2 mm.  

The openscad file is completely parametric if you'd like to change your settings. You may want to change the thickness or overall length to affect the tension. 

Also, I found another user's thing to be amazing about quieting my delta printer down. These dampening feet are an amazing improvement.
