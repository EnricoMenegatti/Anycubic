# Summary

This is a tool rig for the Anycubic i3 Mega. It has slots for all tools that come with the printer as well as a slide for an extra SD card and a bowl that can be used to store small items, f.x. filament clips etc. I haven't tried printing it without supports, so I can only recommend printing it with supports. Also the settings are pretty relaxed, you can experiment with other settings as well.

# How I Designed This

Created with Blender, mixed the tool box design from Bogdanko's incredibly solid Anycubic i3 Mega Led Holder set and used derLowy's mount to screw it on to the printer. Then I arranged Bogdanko's setup in a different way that fits my needs more.
