# Summary

This is my design of the manual extruder knob thumb screw. Fits right over the stepper motor shaft with a press fit. 

Designed for 5mm D shafts, with a keyed flat side (most common, and fits any 40mm stepper motors with 5mm shaft)

I had to manually adjust the scale to get it to fit right. I printed four of these with 102%, 104%, 106%, and 108%. And it turns out 104% scaled worked best for me, 106% fit just right, but didn't need a lot of force to remove from the shaft. So I opted to go with the 104% scaling. (Printed on Anycubic i3 Mega)

I decided to use the 106% scaled piece on the Tevo Tarantula extruder =)

Settings:
- 0.1mm Z-resolution
- 0.4mm nozzle
- No support
- Solid Fill
